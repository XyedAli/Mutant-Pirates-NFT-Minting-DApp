    <noscript>We have been in the market from the Past one Year. We have seen Projects come and go but only a few have delivered on their promises. So, the idea is to create something unique with lots of utilities that will benefit our community for the coming years. Having a MUTANT NFT is just not having an NFT but actually being a part of an organic culture. Which will increase the value of your NFT possession.</noscript>
